## Acknowledgments

Huge thanks to the following packages/webpages that helped make my app what it is:

- joleary and the CS 160 staff for the Phone/Watch communication code
- The [Ion](https://github.com/koush/ion) library that simplifies fetching images from the internet
- [http://jasonmcreynolds.com/?p=388](http://jasonmcreynolds.com/?p=388) for the shake detection code
- And, of course, the Android tutorials and API that are both frustratingly unclear and helpful :D
